## Welcome to saxHelper

**saxHelper** is a page intended to people trying to learn to play saxophone. I find it a little difficult location all the tools I needed sometimes and it consumed the little time I had to practice. It contains tools I find useful for my practices like:

- Fingering Chart
- Sheet Notes
- Random Notes
- And some others...

I found this to be very useful specially random notes that I use a test to see if I'm learning what I practice.

I'll be including tips to some "brick walls" I've found along the way to learn playing my alto sax.
